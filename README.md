# Tutorial
In this tutorial, you’ll walk through the complete lifecycle of a Blue-Green Deployment — from setting up two environments to testing, switching traffic, and automating the whole process.

You’ll start small, with two versions of an application (Blue and Green), and gradually build toward a fully automated continuous delivery pipeline

# Motivation & Why It Matters to DevOps
In modern DevOps practices, continuous delivery (CD) means deploying changes frequently and reliably. However, frequent deployments increase the risk of service disruption. Blue-Green deployment provides a safe deployment pattern that enables:

- Zero-downtime releases – because traffic is switched between two live environments.
- Instant rollback – reverting to the previous (Blue) version is immediate if something goes wrong.
- Production-like testing – the Green version can be tested in a real environment before users see it.
- Continuous Delivery enablement – teams can release confidently, knowing they can roll back safely.

This approach bridges the gap between development and operations by reducing deployment risks, aligning with DevOps principles of automation, reliability, and rapid iteration.
