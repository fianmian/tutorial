Let's run a smoke test for the green version in the terminal:
``` bash
kubectl port-forward deploy/hello-green 9090:5678 &
PID=$!
sleep 2
RESPONSE=$(curl -s http://localhost:9090)
kill $PID

if [[ "$RESPONSE" == "Hello from GREEN" ]]; then
  echo "✅ Smoke test passed"
  exit 0
else
  echo "❌ Smoke test failed"
  exit 1
fi
```{{exec}}

This script performs a **smoke test** on our green Kubernetes deployment by:
1. Temporarily opening access to the service by port-forwarding it. 
2. Sending a test HTTP request to it.
3. Verifying that the response says "Hello from GREEN".

By doing this **smoke test** we can:
- Check that the green pod respond as they should (with "Hello from GREEN").
- If successful → proceed to switch traffic.
- If failed → green is deleted, blue continues serving.

Before continuing to the next step, let's make sure that the green pods are running and that they pass the **smoke test**.
